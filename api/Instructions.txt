---> How to run the container(http://localhost:5023 will be running on the browser)
docker run --name myapp_c2 -p 5023:5000 -d myapp
* Where:
 - myapp_c2 is the new container
 - -p 5023:5000: This option is used to map ports between the Docker container and
 the host system. It is specifying that port 5023 on the host should be mapped to port 5000
 in the Docker container. The format is -p host_port:container_port.
  - -d: This option runs the Docker container in detached mode. It means the container will run in the background,
  and you will get the terminal prompt back (It's not blocking the terminal).
  - myapp: This is the name of the Docker image used to create the container. It specifies which image should be used as the base for the container.
---> How to start an existing container?
docker start myapp_c2
