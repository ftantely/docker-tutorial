---> How to see all the images?
docker images
---> How to run an image to create a container?
(http://localhost:5023/ will not be running on the browser)
docker run --name myapp_c1  myapp
* Where myapp_c1 is the name of the container and myapp is the image
---> How to stop a container
* Open a new terminal to check which container is running:
docker ps
*Stop container
docker stop myapp_c1
---> How to run the container(http://localhost:5023 will be running on the browser)
docker run --name myapp_c2 -p 5023:5000 -d myapp
* Where:
 - myapp_c2 is the new container
 - -p 5023:5000: This option is used to map ports between the Docker container and
 the host system. It is specifying that port 5023 on the host should be mapped to port 5000
 in the Docker container. The format is -p host_port:container_port.
  - -d: This option runs the Docker container in detached mode. It means the container will run in the background,
  and you will get the terminal prompt back (It's not blocking the terminal).
  - myapp: This is the name of the Docker image used to create the container. It specifies which image should be used as the base for the container.
---> How to start an existing container?
docker start myapp_c2

 3_Layer_Caching
 ---> Any time you make a change to your app, you need to build a new image
docker build -t myapp3 .
- all the layers below the changed layer will be rerun

---> How to delete a container?
docker container rm myapp_c2
---> How to delete unused images
docker image rm myapp3
---> How to delete in use image

---> How to delete all images and containers all at once?

---> How to create an image with a version?
docker build -t myapp:v1 .
*Where v1 is a version of the image
---> How to create a container from a specific image version?
docker run --name myapp_c -p 5023:5000 -d myapp:v1
